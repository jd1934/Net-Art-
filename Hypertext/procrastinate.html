    <h1>Procrastination Spiral</h1>

    <p>You tell yourself you’ll start in a few minutes… but those minutes keep stretching. One distraction turns into another, and suddenly the whole day slips away. You feel guilty, frustrated, and stuck in a loop you didn’t mean to fall into.</p>

    <p>It happens — and tomorrow is another chance.</p>
