    <h1>Productive Afternoon</h1>

    <p>You find your rhythm. Your focus sharpens, and everything starts to flow. Tasks that felt overwhelming earlier suddenly feel manageable. You’re proud of yourself — this is the version of you that feels in control.</p>

    <p>This productive streak carries you through the rest of the day.</p>
