    <h1>Rush Out Late</h1>

    <p>You rush out the door, barely grabbing your things. Your heart is racing, and everything feels chaotic. You’re trying to catch up, but the day already feels like it’s slipping out of your hands.</p>

    <p>Where does this rushed start lead you?</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="tired.html">You arrive feeling tired and overwhelmed.</a></li>
      <li><a href="procrastinate.html">You give up on being productive and fall into procrastination.</a></li>
    </ul>
