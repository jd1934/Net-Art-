<body>Ooh
<p><strong>I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized
<p><em>Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
<p>So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night &nbsp;
If the world was ending, <br> I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
<h2>Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
<a>'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night <ul>
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Right next to you
Next to you
<ol>Right next to you
Oh-oh, oh
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
<hr>If the party was over and our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you
Ooh
I'd wanna be next to you
