    <!-- Your poem goes here -->
    Ooh<br><br>

    I just woke up from a dream<br>
    Where you and I had to say goodbye<br>
    And I don't know what it all means<br>
    But since I survived, I realized<br><br>

    <i>Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow<br>
    Nobody's promised tomorrow</i><br><br>

    <b>So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night</b><br>
    Like it's the last night<br>
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
    If the party was over and our time on Earth was through<br>
    I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile<br>
    If the world was ending, I'd wanna be next to you<br>
    Ooh<br><br>

    Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream<br>
    I don't even wanna do this anymore&nbsp;but I keep going<br>
</p>
